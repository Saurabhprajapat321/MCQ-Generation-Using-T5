# MCQ-Generation-Using-T5


MCQ (Multiple Choice Question) generation using the T5 model involves fine-tuning the Text-to-Text Transfer Transformer (T5) to generate questions, correct answers, and plausible distractors from a given context or passage. By leveraging T5â€™s ability to treat every NLP task as a text-to-text problem, this approach enables automated and contextually relevant MCQ creation, making it useful for educational and assessment tools.
